PROMPTS LOG - Feature Voting System
==========================================

CLAUDE CODE PROMPTS - Feature Voting System
===========================================

PROMPT 1: Project Setup & Planning
-----------------------------------
User: "let's do it! I suggest using neon as it's a postgresql instance and it's all setup. Can we proceed?"

Claude Response: Created comprehensive project plan including:
- Tech stack selection (Neon PostgreSQL, Node.js/Express, React, React Native, Prisma)
- Database schema design
- API endpoint planning
- Project structure
- Implementation roadmap

Next: Will create project structure and begin implementation

PROMPT 2: Database Schema Setup
-------------------------------
Write each prompt I send to you into a file prompts.txt, so I can audit the work.

Create a Prisma schema file for a feature voting system with the following requirements:
- Features table: id, title, description, authorName, votes count, timestamps  
- Votes table: id, feature_id (foreign key), voter_ip, timestamp
- Prevent duplicate votes per IP per feature
- Use PostgreSQL as the database
- Set up proper relationships and constraints

Save this as backend/prisma/schema.prisma

PROMPT 3: Backend API Setup
---------------------------
Create an Express.js backend server with the following:
- CORS enabled for frontend communication
- Routes for: GET /api/features, POST /api/features, POST /api/features/:id/vote
- Prisma client integration
- Error handling middleware
- Rate limiting for voting
- IP-based duplicate vote prevention
- Environment variable configuration for database

Create the main server file as backend/server.js and routes in backend/routes/features.js

PROMPT 4: React Frontend
------------------------
Create a React frontend application with TypeScript that includes:
- Feature list component showing all features sorted by votes
- Add feature form component  
- Voting buttons with optimistic updates
- Error handling and loading states
- Responsive design using CSS modules or styled-components
- API integration using axios
- Real-time vote updates

Structure the app with components in src/components/ and services in src/services/

PROMPT 5: React Native Mobile App  
---------------------------------
Create a React Native app for iOS with:
- Feature list screen with voting functionality
- Add feature screen with form
- Navigation between screens
- Native styling that follows iOS design guidelines
- API integration matching the web frontend
- AsyncStorage for simple state persistence
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

PROMPT 6: Database Connection & Environment
-------------------------------------------
Create the following configuration files:
- .env.example with all required environment variables
- .gitignore file for Node.js, React, and React Native
- package.json scripts for development workflow
- README.md with setup and run instructions

Configure connection to Neon PostgreSQL database

PROMPT 7: Testing & Error Handling
----------------------------------
Add comprehensive error handling:
- Database connection errors
- Invalid input validation
- Rate limiting responses
- Network failure handling in frontend
- Duplicate vote prevention feedback
- Form validation on both web and mobile

Create basic tests for the API endpoints

PROMPT 8: Deployment & Documentation
------------------------------------
Create deployment configuration and documentation:
- Docker setup for containerization
- Railway/Render deployment configs
- Vercel/Netlify frontend deployment
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- API documentation
- Troubleshooting guide

PROMPT 9: Codebase Analysis & Issue Resolution
----------------------------------------------
User: "could you help me to solve it? mobile\src\components\AddFeatureForm.tsx has wrong imports for Feature type and API service"

Claude analyzed existing codebase structure and identified key issues:
- Incorrect import paths for Feature type (should be from '../types/Feature')
- Wrong API service import (should be 'apiService' not 'featuresApi')
- Mix of web React and React Native components in mobile directory
- Environment variable configuration inconsistencies

Resolution: Updated imports to use correct paths and consistent naming conventions

PROMPT 10: Environment Configuration & Server Setup
---------------------------------------------------
User: "About envs and servers to run, these are my envs... what commands to start each server?"

Claude provided complete server startup instructions and identified port mismatches:
- Backend running on port 5000 vs frontend expecting port 3001
- Mobile app needing proper environment configuration  
- Fixed environment variable consistency across all .env files

Commands provided:
- Backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm start` 
- Mobile: `cd mobile && npx expo start` (then press 'w' for web)

PROMPT 11: Prisma Client Generation & Database Issues
-----------------------------------------------------
User: Backend failing with "Prisma client did not initialize yet. Please run 'prisma generate'"

Claude diagnosed and resolved Prisma configuration issues:
- Prisma client not properly generated for the project structure
- Custom output path conflicts in schema.prisma
- Database migration needed for Neon PostgreSQL

Resolution: 
- Updated schema.prisma to use standard Prisma client output
- Ran `npx prisma generate` and `npx prisma db push`
- Fixed import paths to use standard `@prisma/client`

PROMPT 12: API Data Format Mismatch Resolution
----------------------------------------------
User: "POST request not working - getting 'Title and author name are required' error"

Claude identified critical data format inconsistency:
- Frontend sending `author_name` (snake_case) 
- Backend/Mobile expecting `authorName` (camelCase)
- API validation failing due to field name mismatch

Resolution: Updated frontend to consistently use `authorName` across all platforms

PROMPT 13: CORS Configuration for Multi-Platform Support
--------------------------------------------------------
User: "Mobile app getting CORS errors when trying to POST"

Claude implemented comprehensive CORS solution:
- Backend CORS initially only configured for `http://localhost:3000`
- Mobile app running on `http://localhost:8081` needed CORS access
- Environment variable configuration for multiple allowed origins

Resolution:
- Updated CORS configuration to accept both origins: `['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8081']`
- Added proper CORS headers for preflight requests
- Configured environment variables for flexible origin management
